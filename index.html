<h1>Hi, I'm Jen!</h1>
<p>I'm a biological sciences student at University College London. I'm interested in genomics and evolution, and I'm currently pursuing a career in computational biology.</p>
<p>I'm looking to develop my coding skills and learn new techniques, and built this website to showcase some of the projects I aim to build.</p>
<p>When I'm not thinking about biology or coding, I can usually be found trying to write short stories or folding too many origami cranes.</p>
