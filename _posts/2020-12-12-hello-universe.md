For so long, I've been saying, "*Jen*. Make yourself a website. Take all the coding knowledge you've accumulated from a decade or so (more on that in the next post!) and make something with it."

Well, here we are. One website that's actually viewable to the entire Internet, powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). 

For a great tutorial for getting a site up and off the ground using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, I'd recommend [this one by Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#). It's the one I used; this blog looks a lot like the demo site at the time of writing. In time, I'll make it a bit more of my own. Stay tuned!

(Edited 17/12/2020: Site is buing rebuilt using Bootstrap. Continue to stay tuned.)

Thanks for reading my first post; I can't wait to see what happens next.

Onwards and upwards!
